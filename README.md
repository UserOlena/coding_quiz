## General Information
- Code Quiz offers a dropdown menu with a selection of three coding subjects (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) to choose from.
- For each subject, there are six questions presented with four answer options in a button format for each question.
- Once the user selects a subject for the quiz and clicks the `start` button, a timer begins counting down from `60 seconds`.
- If the user clicks on one of the answer buttons, the `<body>` and the selected `<button>` elements will change their background color to `red` if the answer is incorrect or `green` if the chosen answer is correct.
- In the event that the user selects a wrong answer, the `timer will subtract 10 seconds` from the remaining time.
- Once the user clicks on one of the provided answer buttons, the web application automatically loads the next set of questions and answers.
- The quiz ends when the user answers all the provided questions within the provided timeframe, or when the timer reaches 0 seconds remaining.
- At the end of the quiz, the user is provided with their quiz result presented as a percentage, where 100% is the maximum achievable score.
- Upon completion of the quiz, the user is prompted to enter their initials to save their score result on the High Score Board.
- If the user provides their initials, the quiz result is saved to the Local Storage.
- The user can access the High Score Board at any time, even if the page is reloaded, unless they click the `Clear High Scores` button. If the user clicks this button, all data related to the Quiz Results will be deleted from the Local Storage.
